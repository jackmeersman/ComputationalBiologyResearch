# ComputationalBiologyResearch
This research was designed to provide future computational biology and environmental researchers with quality, complete, and easy-to-access biological models of 36 different, toxin-producing cyanobacteria species. Scripts were also written in MATLAB code that could be used to assemble and present useful data from any directory of properly formatted in silico biological models.
