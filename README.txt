# ComputationalBiologyResearch
This research was designed to provide future computational biology and environmental researchers with quality, complete,
and easy-to-access biological models of 36 different, toxin-producing cyanobacteria species. Scripts were also written
in MATLAB and Python code that could be used to assemble and present useful data from any directory of properly
formatted in silico biological models.
